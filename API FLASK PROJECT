Project Name: Python Flask REST API with SQLAlchemy Integration

Description:
In this project, I designed and developed a basic REST API using Python Flask. The primary goal was to create a versatile and efficient API that allows users to interact with data through standard HTTP methods. 
Leveraging Flask's capabilities, I implemented endpoints to handle various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for data resources.
To enhance the API's functionality and enable data storage, I integrated Flask with SQLAlchemy, a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. 
This integration facilitated seamless communication with the database, allowing the API to store and retrieve data efficiently.
Throughout the development process, I learned how to structure API routes, handle requests, and deliver appropriate responses. 
Additionally, I gained valuable insights into database management and how to utilize SQLAlchemy to create, manage, and manipulate data models.
By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated proficiency in building RESTful APIs with Flask, integrating them with a database using SQLAlchemy, and effectively managing data operations. 
This experience further solidified my understanding of backend development and equipped me with practical skills that are highly relevant in the world of web application development.
